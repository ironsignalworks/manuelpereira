🌿 Core Brand DNA (Creative Direction Summary)
Element	Expression	Notes
Essence	Ancient touch, modern calm.	Grounded in Traditional Chinese Medicine and jungle atmosphere — never “new age fluff.”
Mood	Rooted · Ethereal · Slow · Intelligent · Humble	Calm confidence rather than luxury spa gloss.
Voice	Softly instructive, poetic yet clear	A teacher and healer, not a marketer. Words flow like breath — short lines, natural rhythm.
Texture	Botanical · Mineral · Breath · Mist	Layers of natural imagery and subtle animation evoke a living environment.
Tempo	Measured · Breathing · Flowing	Visual rhythm should match meditative breathing — slow fade-ins, deliberate pacing.
🪷 Extended Visual Language
1. Color Field

Use color as emotion, not decoration.

Layer	Color	Function
Base	Warm ivory, pale sand	Calm and grounding background
Organic Tones	Driftwood, taupe, muted ochre	Support body text and dividers
Life / Vitality	Sage, olive, moss, jade	Accent and buttons — symbolizes energy flow
Mystical Depth	Deep forest green, mossy teal	Shadows, overlays, footer gradient
Highlight / Energy	Muted gold or soft amber	For hover states or fine detailing (qi shimmer)

Optional: use subtle radial gradients to simulate morning light filtering through leaves.

2. Typography System
Type	Example	Use
Headings (Serif)	Cormorant Garamond, Playfair Display, or Noto Serif SC	Traditional wisdom; elegance
Body (Sans)	Inter, Work Sans, Noto Sans JP	Modern readability
Accents / Symbolic Glyphs	Subtle Hanzi (氣, 靜, 風) or line seals in SVG	Use sparingly to create moments of reverence

Typography hierarchy should breathe — generous line height, no crowding, lots of white/negative space.

3. Imagery System

Hero layer:
→ Lush, immersive, moving forest light. A brief video loop or cinemagraph of leaves + water movement.
→ Subtle overlay mist gradient from bottom → top.

Detail imagery:
→ Hands in treatment, bamboo, ceramic bowls, soft fabric, dew drops.
→ All natural light. Avoid anything glossy or “stock spa.”

Texture overlays:
→ Paper grain, stone texture, or leaf shadow (opacity 3–8%).
→ Optional animated mist particles using CSS or Lottie.

🧭 Interaction & Motion Guidelines
Motion	Description
Scroll behavior	Parallax reveals — content emerges as if mist clears.
Hover states	Slight light bloom or gold shimmer — qi activation.
Transitions	400–800ms fades, ease-in-out; never jarring or fast.
Microinteractions	Floating leaves or water ripples reacting subtly to cursor.
Loading state	Animated seal or rotating meridian circle (SVG outline).
